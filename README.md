## Figma 

I started out in Figma with the smallest screen - and tried to develop it up to larger desktops. I was kind of unhappy with the development of it in Figma and lost a lot of time doing it. 
<br>

However, what I decided to keep from my Figma designs were the font as well as the icon I used for my site.

## Key points


At this stage of my project, I started to think that somethings needed to be implemented. 
Namely, 

<em>
 <ul>
 <li>Colours;</li>
 <li>3 choice, titled navbar;</li>
 <li>Simple design;</li>
 <li>Splash image;</li>
 <li>Education/experience/skills;</li>
 <li>Contact.</li>
 </ul>
</em>

## First design...
<img src="/pictures/20.png">

<br>

<em>
Only could get so far with my skills
Consulted 2 web development professionals with 10+ years experience each;
One said to use bootstrap - the other said do not use bootstrap…
I considered what to do, aware that it would take me a while to learn bootstrap - but I thought I would give it a go…
Lots of trial and error...
</em>
 
 <br>
 
 <h3>solution? Bootstrap!</h3>

## Navbar

<br>

## Jumbotron

<p> I loved the jumbotron feature in Bootstrap - so I decided to look for some photographs on Upsplash that might reflect my personality. Initially, i chose some pictures of coffee cups as well as records - because I love these things. But I ended up choosing a picture of a computer and glasses</p>

<br>

## Content area (grid - 12 sections)
<p> Bootstrap uses a grid design where the page is divided into 12 sections - and the coder chooses the size the page might be viewed on usually. 

There are four classes:

<ul>
<li>xs (for phones)</li>
<li>sm (for tablets)</li>
<li>md (for desktops)</li>
<li>lg (for larger desktops)</li>

## Devicons

<br>

<img src="/pictures/24.png">

<br>

I got this link from Nathaniel who linked it for us in slack. I had some troble increasing the size of them - but I figured out that they were increased by 'font-size'. <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">Devicon link</a>


## Contact form

<br>

<img src="/pictures/25.png">

Unfortunately, it doesn’t work - I realised I needed to integrate some PHP coding for it to link up. Found an <a href="http://formspree.io/">online contact form</a> but I couldn’t integrate it in a uniform style...

## ..actual email link - contact

<br>

## Social links in footer

<br>

I found a really nice addition in Bootstrap which lets you link 'social network' links in a stylish way, so I pinched them for my footer.

## github/netlify

Had trouble actually getting used to github
Got it - but made mistake of naming index file something else
Hosted - but didn’t display as I intended… needs work
https://zenidith.github.io/portfolio/
… to be continued:
Fix the problem to display on various devices
Complete site map, contact form
Optimise images
Optimise html/css with minify.
Make it more ME
Compile all information in Read Me for Github
Complete!

### Challenges

### Optimisation

<br>

I still need to consider how to optimise my images/html/css and design for speed/easy of use/appeal.
