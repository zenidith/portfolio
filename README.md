## Discussion


## ...:

### Optimisation
~~remove h3 once game starts~~

~~play again button~~  

~~restart game logic~~

~~drop down colour menu~~

 ~~disable alt user selection~~


### Challenges
make win / game over screen more eventful


## 'Future'
~~a draw results in the last player being awarded a point~~

cruel players can change their colors multiple times, locking
out other player from choosing a color.

if one player highlights 'blue' using keys instead of clicking and second player selects 'blue' then both players will end up being represented as blue

~~players can both choose white~~

## Licence

It's tic-tac toe!
