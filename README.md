## Colour scheme...

A colour scheme came to me randomly.

<br>

<strong>
<ul>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Silver</li>
<li>Purple</li>
</ul>
</strong>

<br>

<p> Although there was no actual rhyme or reason to me choosing these colours. I checked later on the Adobe triad wheel - to see if they linked at all, stylistically, but there was no connection. So I kinda just used a gradient version of purple in the content section later on. </p>

<br>

## Pinterest:

<a href="https://au.pinterest.com/kaynesheenan/portfolio-website/">my pinterest board for portfolio project</a>.

<p> I was a little hesitant to use Pinterest, because I didn't really see the point of it, but I just started to look at photos by searching the three colours that had just come to me. I did find some interesting photos of colours that I like, and did try to emulate these actual colours on the page. I think there was some benefit in looking at photos and letting your imagination flow a little bit. I will try to use this again, along with more 'mood board' applications. </p>

## Figma 

I started out in Figma with the smallest screen - and tried to develop it up to larger desktops. I was kind of unhappy with the development of it in Figma and lost a lot of time doing it. 
<br>

<img src="/pictures/18.png">

<p> However, what I decided to keep from my Figma designs were the font as well as the icon I used for my site. Funnily, my DJ name is 'Malware', so I decided to find an image of a 'malware' icon, to integrate into my 'brand'/portfolio.</p>

## Key points


At this stage of my project, I started to think that somethings needed to be implemented. 
Namely, 

<em>
 <ul>
 <li>Colours;</li>
 <li>3 choice, titled navbar;</li>
 <li>Simple design;</li>
 <li>Splash image;</li>
 <li>Education/experience/skills;</li>
 <li>Contact.</li>
 </ul>
</em>

## First design...
<img src="/pictures/20.png">

<br>

<em>
Only could get so far with my skills
Consulted 2 web development professionals with 10+ years experience each;
One said to use bootstrap - the other said do not use bootstrap…
I considered what to do, aware that it would take me a while to learn bootstrap - but I thought I would give it a go…
Lots of trial and error...
</em>
 
 <br>
 
 <h3>solution? Bootstrap!</h3>

## Navbar

<br>

## Jumbotron

<p> I loved the jumbotron feature in Bootstrap - so I decided to look for some photographs on Upsplash that might reflect my personality. Initially, i chose some pictures of coffee cups as well as records - because I love these things. But I ended up choosing a picture of a computer and glasses</p>

<br>

## Content area (grid - 12 sections)
<p> Bootstrap uses a grid design where the page is divided into 12 sections - and the coder chooses the size the page might be viewed on usually. 

There are four classes:

<ul>
<li>xs (for phones)</li>
<li>sm (for tablets)</li>
<li>md (for desktops)</li>
<li>lg (for larger desktops)</li>

<br>

<p> I decided to have 3 sections - the first takes up half the page (6/12) and the other two sections take up one quarter each (3/12). I had to adjust the fonts for the blurb and devicons individually for each section - I played with pixel size, em as well as percentage</p>

## Devicons

<br>

<br>

I got this link from Nathaniel who linked it for us in slack. I had some troble increasing the size of them - but I figured out that they were increased by 'font-size'. <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">Devicon link</a>


## Contact form

<br>

<img src="/pictures/25.png">

Unfortunately, it doesn’t work - I realised I needed to integrate some PHP coding for it to link up. Found an <a href="http://formspree.io/">online contact form</a> but I couldn’t integrate it in a uniform style...

## ..actual email link - contact

<br>

## Social links in footer

<br>

I found a really nice addition in Bootstrap which lets you link 'social network' links in a stylish way, so I pinched them for my footer.

## github/netlify

Had trouble actually getting used to github
Got it - but made mistake of naming index file something else
Hosted - but didn’t display as I intended… needs work
https://zenidith.github.io/portfolio/
… to be continued:
Fix the problem to display on various devices
Complete site map, contact form
Optimise images
Optimise html/css with minify.
Make it more ME
Compile all information in Read Me for Github
Complete!

### Challenges

### Optimisation

<br>

I still need to consider how to optimise my images/html/css and design for speed/easy of use/appeal.
