## Key points
At this stage of my project, I started to think that somethings needed to be implemented. 
Namely, 

Colours;
3 choice, titled navbar;
Simple design;
Splash image;
Education/experience/skills;
Contact.

## First design...
(picture)

Only could get so far with my skills
Consulted 2 web development professionals with 10+ years experience each;
One said to use bootstrap - the other said do not use bootstrap…
I considered what to do, aware that it would take me a while to learn bootstrap - but I thought I would give it a go…
Lots of trial and error...

## Devicons

I got this link from Nathaniel who linked it for us in slack. I had some troble increasing the size of them - but I figured out that they were increased by 'font-size'. <a href="http://konpa.github.io/devicon/">Devicon link</a>

## Contact form

Unfortunately, it doesn’t work - I realised I needed to integrate some PHP coding for it to link up. Found an <a href="http://formspree.io/">online contact form</a> but I couldn’t integrate it in a uniform style...
